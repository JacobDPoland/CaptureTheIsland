        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">📘 Project Background</h3>
        <p>
            This project was developed as part of our <strong>Internet Programming (COSC 3351)</strong> class.
            It was inspired by the National Cyber League (NCL), where both Mohammed and Jacob
            competed. Mohammed's team placed <strong>19th in the nation</strong>, which heavily motivated
            the idea of creating a beginner-friendly CTF platform that teaches cybersecurity skills in
            a hands-on, interactive way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our goal was to build a complete web-based environment where new cybersecurity
            students can practice solving real challenges involving cryptography, OSINT, password
            cracking, networking, scripting, and more.
