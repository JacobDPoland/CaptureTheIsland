    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">Meet the Team</h2>
    <p>
        Capture The Island is built and maintained by a small team of
        cybersecurity enthusiasts and educators.  We believe that hands‑on
        challenges are the best way to learn defensive and offensive
        security skills.  Our mission is to make high‑quality CTF
        experiences accessible to students and professionals alike.

                        Jacob is the original creator of the Capture The Island project concept. He designed the
                        overall site structure, built the foundational backend systems, and implemented secure user
                        management features—including password hashing and administrative oversight tools. His early
                        architectural work established the framework that the rest of the project was built upon.

                        Mohammed served as the lead developer and primary challenge architect for Capture The Island.
                        He built the full functional website, implemented the interfaces for every challenge module,
                        and authored nearly all of the CTF challenges from scratch—spanning cryptography, networking,
                        forensics, OSINT, and password-cracking. His work transformed the initial concept into a fully
                        realized, production-ready cybersecurity training platform.

                        David contributed to the design, accessibility, and user-experience improvements
                        across the Capture The Island platform. They implemented high-contrast accessibility
                        features, keyboard-friendly navigation, and streamlined UI components for a more
                        inclusive learning environment. David also assisted in improving page structure,
                        styling, and layout consistency throughout the site.
