    <p>
        Capture The Island is built and maintained by a small team of
        cybersecurity enthusiasts and educators.  We believe that hands‑on
        challenges are the best way to learn defensive and offensive
        security skills.  Our mission is to make high‑quality CTF
        experiences accessible to students and professionals alike.
